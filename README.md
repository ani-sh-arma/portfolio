## Mobile App Plan for Portfolio Data Management

__1. Mobile App Framework Selection:__ I recommend using __React Native__ for building the mobile application.

- __Cross-Platform__: Allows you to build for both iOS and Android from a single codebase, saving development time.
- __JavaScript/TypeScript__: Leverages your existing React knowledge, making the transition smoother.
- __Ecosystem__: Strong community support and a rich ecosystem of libraries for various functionalities.

__2. Firebase Integration:__ Firebase will serve as the backend for your portfolio data.

- __Firestore (NoSQL Database)__: Ideal for storing structured data like your summary, skills, projects, and experience. It offers real-time synchronization, which can be beneficial for immediate updates.
- __Firebase Authentication__: To secure your app, you'll implement authentication (e.g., email/password, Google Sign-In) to ensure only authorized users can update the data.
- __Firebase Storage (Optional)__: If you plan to upload images (e.g., for projects), Firebase Storage can be used to store these assets.

__3. Data Model in Firebase (Firestore):__ The data will be structured into collections, mirroring your portfolio sections. Each document within a collection will represent an item in that section.

- __`summary` collection__:
  - Document: `user_profile`
    - Fields: `name`, `title`, `bio`, `profileImageUrl`

- __`skills` collection__:

  - Document: `skill_id_1`
    - Fields: `name`, `level` (e.g., "Advanced", "Intermediate"), `category` (e.g., "Frontend", "Backend")
  - Document: `skill_id_2`
    - ...

- __`projects` collection__:

  - Document: `project_id_1`
    - Fields: `title`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `projectUrl`, `githubUrl`, `technologiesUsed` (array)
  - Document: `project_id_2`
    - ...

- __`experience` collection__:

  - Document: `experience_id_1`
    - Fields: `title`, `company`, `duration`, `description` (array of bullet points)
  - Document: `experience_id_2`
    - ...

- __`contact` collection__:
  - Document: `contact_info`
    - Fields: `email`, `linkedinUrl`, `githubUrl`

__4. Mobile App Features:__ The mobile app will provide an interface to manage this data.

- __Authentication Screen__: User login/logout.

- __Dashboard/Navigation__: A main screen to navigate between different portfolio sections (Summary, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact).

- __CRUD Operations for each section__:

  - __Summary__: An edit form to update the single summary document.
  - __Skills__: List of skills, with options to add new skills, edit existing ones, and delete skills.
  - __Projects__: List of projects, with forms to add new projects, edit details, and delete projects.
  - __Experience__: List of experiences, with forms to add new entries, edit details, and delete entries.
  - __Contact__: An edit form to update contact information.

- __Image Upload (if applicable)__: Integration with Firebase Storage for uploading profile pictures or project images.

__5. Future Portfolio Website Integration:__ Once the mobile app is functional and data is in Firebase, your existing React portfolio website will be updated to:

- Initialize Firebase SDK.
- Fetch data from the respective Firestore collections (e.g., `summary`, `skills`, `projects`, `experience`, `contact`).
- Replace the hardcoded data or local state management with data fetched from Firebase.
